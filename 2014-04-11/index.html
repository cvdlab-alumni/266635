		<h2>Temple of Concordia, The Valley of the Temples:</h2>
		
		The Valley of the Temples, Sicilian: (Vaddi di li Tempri) is an archaeological site in Agrigento (ancient Greek Akragas), Sicily, southern Italy.
		<br>It is one of the most outstanding examples of Greater Greece art and architecture, and is one of the main attractions of Sicily as well as a national monument of Italy.
		<br>The area was included in the UNESCO Heritage Site list in 1997.<br> Much of the excavation and restoration of the temples was due to the efforts of archaeologist 
		Domenico Antonio Lo Faso Pietrasanta (1783&#45;1863),<br> who was the Duke of Serradifalco from 1809 through 1812.
		The term "valley" is a misnomer, the site being located on a ridge outside the town of Agrigento.
		The Valley includes remains of seven temples, all in Doric style. The ascription of the names, apart from that of the Olympeion, are a mere tradition established in Renaissance times. The temples are:
			<ul>
				<li>Temple of Juno, built in the 5th century BC and burnt in 406 BC by the Carthaginians. It was usually used for the celebration of weddings.</li>
				<li>Temple of Concordia, whose name comes from a Latin inscription found nearby, and which was also built in the 5th century BC. Turned into a church in the 6th century AD, 	 it is now one of the best preserved in the Valley.</li>
				<li>Temple of Heracles, who was one of the most venerated deities in the ancient Akragas. It is the most ancient in the Valley: destroyed by an earthquake, it consists today 
					of only eight columns.</li>
				<li>Temple of Olympian Zeus, built in 480 BC to celebrate the city-state's victory over Carthage. It is characterized by the use of large scale atlases.</li>
				<li>Temple of Castor and Pollux. Despite its remains including only four columns, it is now the symbol of modern Agrigento.</li>
				<li>Temple of Vulcan, also dating from the 5th century BC. It is thought to have been one of the most imposing constructions in the valley; it is now however one of the most 
					eroded.</li>
				<li>Temple of Asclepius, located far from the ancient town's walls; it was the goal of pilgrims seeking cures for illness.</li>
				<li>The Valley is also home to the so-called Tomb of Theron, a large tuff monument of pyramidal shape; scholars suppose it was built to commemorate the Romans killed in the 
					Second Punic War.</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Temple of Concordia, Agrigento, Sicily:</h2>

		The Temple of Concordia (Greek: Harmonia), built c.440-430 BC, is a greek temple of the ancient city of Akragas, located in the Valle dei Templi in Agrigento.
		<br>This temple, constructed like the nearby Temple of Juno on a solid base designed to overcome the unevenness of the rocky terrain, is considered one of the most notable examples of Ancient Greek architecture on account of its state of preservation.
		<br>The very well-preserved peristasis of six by thirteen columns stands on top of a crepidoma of four steps (measuring 39.44 metres x 16.91 meters). The columns are 6.72 metres high and carved with twenty flutes and harmonious entasis (tapering at the tops of the columns and swelling around the middles). The peristasis is surmounted by an architrave, a frieze of triglyphs and metopes, and a cornice. The tympana are also preserved in situ. The naos, preceded by a pronaos in antis (mirrored by the opisthodomos), is entered through a step.<br> The front walls of the naos, with integrated steps to the roof are preserved, as are the sockets for the wooden beams of the roof on the top of the walls of the naos and in the blocks of the entablature of the peristasis.<br> The exterior and interior of the temple was decorated with polychrome stucco. <br>The sima at the edges of the roof formed a gutter with lion protomes and the roof was covered in marble tiles.
		The temple's transformation into a Christian church involved the removal of the ancient ornamentation,<br> the demolition of the back wall of the naos, the closure of the space between the columns, and the creation of twelve curved openings in the walls of the naos in order to create the canonical three naves - the two lateral naves from the peristasis and the central nave from the naos. The classical altar was destroyed at that time and sacristies arranged in the corners, the whole building almost completely taking on the form of a basilica. Digging occurred inside and outside the church in relation to a High Medieval sepulchre, placed in close contact with the basilica in accordance with custom.
